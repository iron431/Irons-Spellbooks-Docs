## <u>Getting Started</u>

You may quickly notice as your explore your world that you will be finding scrolls. Each scroll contains a spell, similar to an enchanted book. The scroll can be consumed to cast that spell without consuming mana or triggering a cooldown, or brought to the first new workstation added: the Inscription Table. At the inscription table, you are allowed to place a spell book, one either found or crafted, and slot the scroll into it. However, depending on the rarity of the scroll (determined by the spell's level), it may be too powerful for your spell book. In this case, you must go forth on a journey to obtain a better spell book.
![Getting Started](/img/screenshots/inscription_table.png)

## <u>Materials</u>
There are many materials you may stumble upon throughout your adventures in the Overworld and Nether. Some of the important ones are:

### Ink
Ink can be found in magic structures, such as wizard towers, and is the key to crafting scrolls. There are 5 variants, one for each rarity of scroll. When using ink in the Scroll Forge, it will allow you to craft a spell of the corresponding rarity, at the lowest level available. If the minimum rarity of a spell is higher than the ink provided, you will not be able to craft it at all, instead needing a higher quality ink to craft its first level.

### Focuses

There are 9 schools of magic, and you require a magical focus to craft scrolls or gear pertaining to that school. The schools and their focus are:
- Fire - Blaze Rods (Vanilla)
- Ice - Frozen Bones (Dropped from Strays)
- Lightning - Bottles o' Lightning - (Use empty bottle on charged creeper)
- Holy - Divine Pearls (Crafted from gold and amethyst)
- Blood - Blood Vials (Obtained by cooking mobs in a cauldron; put them (or yourself) into a cauldron with a lit campfire beneath them)
- Ender - Ender Pearls (Vanilla)
- Evocation - Emeralds (Vanilla)
- Void - Echo Shards (Vanilla)
- Poison - Poisonous Potatoes (Vanilla, with additional recipe)

### Arcane Essence
Arcane essence is the most common and most important magical material. It can be found in magical structures, or looted from killing magical enemies. Low amounts of it may craft weak magic items, but its primary purpose is to be condensed into Arcane Cloth or Arcane Ingots, and used in more powerful crafting recipes.

### Runestones
Runestones are a more rare find in magical structures, and are always found as blank runestones. Using 8 focuses, you can craft a runestone to a specific school, and use your inscribed runestone to craft gear related to that school.

### Other
- Hogskin - a new drop from hoglins, and is used to craft magical items
- Cinder Essence - a drop from Ancient Knights (who can be summoned at ancient battleground) and is used to craft upgrade orbs
- Arcane Debris/Arcane Salvage - an ore similar to ancient debris, but is found in the Overworld. A netherite pickaxe is required to harvest it, and the scrap is used in powerful magical recipes.
- Ruined Book - a sculk-infested book that can be found in ancient cities, used for crafting powerful spell books

## <u>Crafting Stations</u>
All of your magical tinkering will be done at the <a href="./blocks/#irons_spellbooks:inscription_table">Inscription Table</a>, Scroll Forge, and Arcane Anvil. (See getting started for Inscription Table)
![Crafting Station](/img/screenshots/tristation.png)

## <u>Scroll Forge</u>
The <a href="./blocks/#irons_spellbooks:scroll_forge">Scroll Forge</a> is a new crafting station that allows the player to craft scrolls by using ink, paper, and a focus. The ink determines the rarity/level, and the focus determines what school of spells you can craft.

## <u>Arcane Anvil</u>
The <a href="./blocks/#irons_spellbooks:arcane_anvil">Arcane Anvil</a> is a new crafting station that is used to combine magic items together, such as:
- Upgrading scrolls (just like enchanted books)
- Upgrade school armor and Spell Books using upgrade orbs
- Imbue swords with a spell (only one at a time, scrolls cannot be retrieved after imbuing them)

![Arcane Anvil](/img/screenshots/arcane_anvil.png)

## <u>Equipment</u>
**Many new pieces of magical equipment can be found, looted, or crafted in this mod.**

Some of these include 5 craftable spell books that follow vanilla progression (iron, diamond, netherite, and so on), 2 Unique spell books that are rare drops from certain mobs and come with pre-slotted spells, and 3 additional spell books that can be found throughout the world.

![Equipment](/img/screenshots/equipment.png)

Additionally, 10 sets of armor are added to the game, including an early game, mid game, and 8 late game sets, each corresponding to a school of magic, giving players additional power for that school while they wear them.
