## <u>Overview</u>

Furthermore, each school can be empowered by specific school related gear, allowing you to become a powerful master of a single school, or mix and match to become a jack of all trades.

### <u>Fire</u>

The Fire school, with a Blaze Rod as its Focus, is centered around damage and damage over time.

### <u>Nature</u>

The Nature school, with a Poisonous Potato as its Focus, is focused on applying debuffs to enemies, with elements of damage to finish them off.

[Nature Spells](../spells/#nature-spells)
### <u>Eldritch</u>

The Eldritch school is not like the others. It is an ancient and powerful way of magic, one that has all but been forgotten; you will be unable to immediately craft or cast Eldritch Spells. However, shreds of ancient Eldritch manuscripts ([Ancient Knowledge Fragment](../items/#irons_spellbooks:ancient_knowledge_fragment)) can still be found scattered throughout the world, and may even be pieced back together with the help of an echo shard to craft a complete [Eldritch Manuscript](../items/#irons_spellbooks:eldritch_manuscript).

Once a manuscript has been restored, it can be consumed to learn a single Eldritch spell, enabling the crafting and casting of it. After being learned, the Echo Shard is used as the focus.
