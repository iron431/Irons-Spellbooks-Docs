This a WIP

## <u>Getting Started</u>
### Inscription Table and World Loot
You may quickly notice as your explore your world that you will be finding scrolls. Each scroll contains a spell, similar to an enchanted book. The scroll can be consumed to cast that spell without consuming mana or triggering a cooldown, or brought to the first new workstation added: the Inscription Table. 

In order to use the inscription table properly, you will need a spell book. Beginner spell books can be found or crafted. The inscription table then lets you slot the scroll into the spell book. 

However, depending on the rarity of the scroll (determined by the spell's level), it may be too powerful for your spell book. In this case, it is time to move on to the intermediate stage.

### Scroll Forge:

The Scroll Forge is a new crafting station that allows the player to craft scrolls by using ink, paper, and a focus. The ink determines the rarity/level, and the focus determines what school of spells you can craft.

### Arcane Anvil:
1
The Arcane Anvil is a new crafting station that is used to combine magic items together, such as:

Upgrading scrolls (just like enchanted books)
Upgrade school armor and Spell Books using upgrade orbs
Imbue swords with a spell (only one at a time, scrolls cannot be retrieved after imbuing them. Imbuements can be removed with shriving stones)
