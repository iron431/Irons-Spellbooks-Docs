## <u>Early Game</u>
### World Loot and The Inscription Table 
The world will be full of magic loot, from resources to scrolls to equipment. In the early game, looting structures will be your primamry source of scrolls.

While it is possible to find scrolls and magic loot in vanilla structures, they will be much more common and powerful in magic structures.

Beginner spell books can be found or crafted. In order use spell books, you will need to bring scrolls to the [Inscription Table](../blocks/#irons_spellbooks:inscription_table).

However, depending on the level of the scroll, it may be too rare for your spell book. In this case, it is time to move on to the intermediate stage.

An early game source of additional mana is the [Wandering Magician](../armor/#Wandering%20Magician) armor set.

## <u>Mid Game</u>
### Powering Up
Up reaching nether level resources, you will unlock an entirely new dynamic to gaining power: The [Scroll Forge](../blocks/#irons_spellbooks:scroll_forge)

The [Scroll Forge](../blocks/#irons_spellbooks:scroll_forge) is used to craft scrolls by using [ink](../#ink), paper, and a [focus](../#focuses). The ink determines the rarity (and therefore level), and the focus determines spell's school.

Intermediate spell books can be crafted using nether resources (ex: [Apprentice's Spell Book](../spellbooks/#irons_spellbooks:gold_spell_book)). 

You should also start to craft stronger armor using [arcane cloth](../items/#irons_spellbooks:magic_cloth). In order to get high quantities of [arcane essence](../items/#irons_spellbooks:arcane_essence), you will need to focus on raiding magical structures.

In order to continue progressing, keep an eye out for [runestones](../#runestones) in magical structures. [Runestones](../#runestones) are used to craft more powerful armor.

## <u>Late Game</u>
### Arcane Anvil and Netherite
Late game is reached by obtaining netherite and vast quantities of basic resources. This will be done most effectively by killing the Dead King boss.

School armor will allow you to specialize in a particular element (ex: [Cryomancer Armor](http://../armor/#Cryomancer)).

Using netherite, you can obtain the [Arcane Anvil](../blocks/#irons_spellbooks:arcane_anvil). The [Arcane Anvil](../blocks/#irons_spellbooks:arcane_anvil) is the most powerful crafting station, used to level up your scrolls, upgrade armor and spell books, and imbue weapons with spells.

Upgrade Orbs are crafted using [Arcane debris](../blocks/#irons_spellbooks:arcane_debris) and [Cinder Essence](../blocks/#irons_spellbooks:cinder_essence). The default maximum amount of times an applicable piece of equipment can be upgraded it 3 times.
 
## <u>Along the way</u>
At every stage of your adventures, be sure to keep an eye out for rings, unique spell books, named spell books, and magic resources!

[Arcane Essence](../items/#irons_spellbooks:arcane_essence) will be the most required material, but is also the most common.

[Runestones](../#runestones) are more rare, but are most often found as a reward for killing a miniboss or in magical treasure chests.
