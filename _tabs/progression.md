## <u>Early Game</u>
### Inscription Table and World Loot
You may quickly notice as your explore your world that you will be finding scrolls. Each scroll contains a spell, similar to an enchanted book. The scroll can be consumed to cast that spell without consuming mana or triggering a cooldown, or brought to the first new workstation added: the [Inscription Table](../blocks/#irons_spellbooks:inscription_table). 

In order to use the inscription table properly, you will need a spell book. Beginner spell books can be found or crafted. The inscription table then lets you slot the scroll into the spell book. 

However, depending on the rarity of the scroll (determined by the spell's level), it may be too powerful for your spell book. In this case, it is time to move on to the intermediate stage.

### Summary
- Crafting
  - [Inscription Table](../blocks/#irons_spellbooks:inscription_table)
  - Starter spell books (ex: [Ironbound Tome](../spellbooks/#irons_spellbooks:iron_spell_book))
  - Basic Armor (ex: [Wandering Magician](../armor/#Wandering%20Magician))
- World Loot
  - Scrolls/Spellbooks found in vanilla chests with a higher drop rate in magical structures and on spell casting mobs.
  - Arcane essence found in magic structures and spell casting mobs (only a small amount needed at this point but save all you find!)

## <u>Mid Game</u>
### The Scroll Forge
The [Scroll Forge](../blocks/#irons_spellbooks:scroll_forge) is a new crafting station that allows the player to craft scrolls by using [ink](../#ink), paper, and a [focus](../#focuses). The ink determines the rarity/level, and the focus determines what school of spells you can craft.

You should begin to craft Intermediate spellbooks using nether resources and diamonds (ex: [Apprentice's Spell Book](../spellbooks/#irons_spellbooks:gold_spell_book)).  You should also start to craft stronger armor using [arcane cloth](../items/#irons_spellbooks:magic_cloth).  

Keep your eye out for [runestones](../#runestones) in magical structures as they will be needed for created spell school related gear.

### Summary
- Crafting
  - [Scroll Forge](../blocks/#irons_spellbooks:scroll_forge)
  - Intermediate spellbooks and armor
- World Loot
  - Runestones (used for crafting more advanced armor)
  - Arcane essence found in magic structures and spell casting mobs (only a small amount needed at this point)

## <u>Late Game</u>
### Arcane Anvil and Netherite
The [Arcane Anvil](../blocks/#irons_spellbooks:arcane_anvil) is a powerful crafting station used to upgrade your scrolls, enhance school armor and imbue weapons with spells.

At this point in the game you should be crafting spell school armor (ex: [Cryomancer Armor](http://../armor/#Cryomancer)) in order to prepare yourself for the toughest battles.

### Summary
